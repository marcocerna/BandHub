BandHub is an webapp that allows user to search for and select any number of favorite bands to save to their user profile.

Upon favoriting a band they’ll be able to add various options to the band’s favorites display such as images, band news articles, current press and blogs, album reviews, touring status, their bio, new releases and relevant Twitter accounts.

When they return to the app (or refresh) they’ll be able to see their bands’ updated info for each of the categories selected (if there happens to be any).

BandHub is a place to show appreciation for music you love and to keep tabs on your favorite bands' happenings.
